# Stickman Run

A running game inspired by the [Dinosaur Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game) by Google, playable in the
Chrome browser while being offline, but featuring a stickman.

## Description

Stickman Run is a single player game. You are playing a stickman who is running increasingly faster and has to avoid
obstacles in order to continue. The goal of the game is to score the most points. You receive one point for each
obstacle you avoid.

The game contains a level system where each new level has an increasingly more difficult obstacle set. The next level
is unlocked by scoring a certain amount of points. The last level continues until the player dies.

The objects included in the levels are as follows:

- Level 1: only small obstacles
